Prerequistes:
Download the executable file and install Python in “C:\Python” folder and add “C:\Python\” and “C:\Python\Scripts” to the system environment variables. We can verify the installation by using the command prompt (CMD).
Install all the dependencies that are required to the run Application

Process:

To run flask on IIS we need to install flask and Wfastcgi

we have to install the IIS feature in the Windows server and enable the CGI role
  Open Server Manager and select Manage > Add Roles and Features.
  Click “Next” and select “Role-based or feature-based installation” and select “Next”
  Select the server (default: server available in server pool) and select “Next”
  Select “Web Server (IIS)”, select “Add Features” and select “Next”
  Accept the default configurations and continue till we see the “Role Services ” screen. Select “CGI” under “Application Development” and select “Next”
  Accept the default configurations and select “Install”.
Enable the FastCGI module
  Go to this path “C:\Python\Scripts\” and execute the “wfastcgi-enable.exe” file. This will enable the FastCGI module and attach it with the IIS server.
Now, copy the “wfastcgi.py” file from “C:\Python\Lib\site-packages\” directory and paste it to “C:\inetpub\wwwroot\FlaskApp\” directory.
Now, we have to provide a few permissions to IIS so that it can access the FlaskApp directory. Open a CMD and change the directory to FlaskApp and execute the following commands:
  icacls . /grant "NT AUTHORITY\IUSR:(OI)(CI)(RX)"
  icacls . /grant "Builtin\IIS_IUSRS:(OI)(CI)(RX)"
Create a Website in IIS Manager
Right click on Web Site > Manage Website > Advanced Settings… > Update the Physical Path value by “C:\inetpub\wwwroot\FlaskApp” and select “OK”
Select “Handler Mappings” in Default Web Site Home screen > Add Module Mapping… > Insert the values as below:
  Request Path: *
  Module: FastCgiModule (Select from the dropdown menu)
  Executable(optional): 
  C:\Python\python.exe|C:\inetpub\wwwroot\FlaskApp\wfastcgi.py
  Name: FlaskHandler
Click on “Request Restrictions” and uncheck “Invoke handler only if request is mapped to:” checkbox and select OK followed by another OK. Select “Yes” if prompted with warning.
Now, verify the module mapping in FastCGI Settings in the root server. This should create an entry in FastCGI Settings.

 Update the FastCGI Application

Double click the application entry in FastCGI settings to edit the application and select “Environment Variables”.
  Click on “…” and open the “EnvironmentVariables Collection Editor”.

  Add the below entries:
  
  Name: PYTHONPATH
  Value: C:\inetpub\wwwroot\FlaskApp
  The PYTHONPATH must point to the directory containing the Flask Application.

  Name: WSGI_HANDLER
  Value: app.app
  The WSGI_HANDLER must point to the application name followed by “.app”. In our case, the application name is “app.py” so WSGI_HANDLER is pointing to “app.app”.
